* Calculate bounding box for loaded models
	- Need an accessor which will scale / rotate accordingly
* Add support for obj materials
* Will need a way to specify that normal map is bump texture and convert in shader, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5281261/generating-a-normal-map-from-a-height-map
	- Branch or permutation? probably branch to avoid explosion of permutations?!

* Need a way to set materials (by name) on a model
* Need support for sampling shadows in custom materials!

* Move model viewer into tools category
* Add more tests models to model viewer
* Move normal debug drawing code and make it work for indexed/non-indexed models

* Begin implementing 3D scene management
	* Need to be able to choose whether a mesh casts shadows

* Write code to generate editor panel from any JS object
	- Update plasma interactive demo to use this
	- Update material demo to use this

* Add support for point lights
* Add support for spotlights

* Look into NW for packaging apps https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/
