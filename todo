* 2D model prims should use material "[none]" because there is no 2D material system
* 3D models should not specify and therefore receive the default material
	- When applying the default material, this *must* be added to the models material list and then referenced as "default"
* Existing samples which use 3D models but *dont* demonstrate materials need a way to manually bind their own shaders
	- Need a version of Engine.Gfx.DrawModel which allows you to override the shaders
	- Need a way to set materials (by name) on a model (updates models material list *not* prims)

* Move model viewer into tools category
* Add support for materials in enginejs model json format
* Add support for obj materials
* Move normal debug drawing code and make it work for indexed/non-indexed models
* Add more tets models to model viewer
* Begin implementing 3D scene management
	* Need to be able to choose whether a mesh casts shadows

* Write code to generate editor panel from any JS object
	- Update plasma interactive demo to use this
	- Update material demo to use this

* Add support for point lights
* Add support for spotlights

* Look into NW for packaging apps https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/
