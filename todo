* Work on material editor
	- Tidy up!
	- Set defaults in init_ui instead of populate_ui
	- Add support for custom materials (plasma)
* Re-skin existing tools

* Add support for optionally centering obj files on load (via hint in descriptor)
* Add more tests models to model viewer
* Will need a way to specify that normal map is bump texture and convert in shader, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5281261/generating-a-normal-map-from-a-height-map
	- Branch or permutation? probably branch to avoid explosion of permutations?!
* Add support for alpha textures (enable blending)

* Add model viewer features
	- Draw model-space basis axis (toggleable)
 	- Move normal debug drawing code and make it work for all models (indexed or non-indexed)
 	- Control lighting
 	- Control rotation
 	- Show details for sub-meshes / materials / poly count etc
 	- Show / hide floor
 	- Toggle roam / orbit cam
* Calculate bounding box for loaded models
	- Need an accessor which will scale / rotate accordingly

* Integrate bullet - https://github.com/adambom/bullet.js/
* Need support for sampling shadows in custom materials!

* Begin implementing 3D scene management
	* Need to be able to choose whether a mesh casts shadows

* Write code to generate editor panel from any JS object
	- Update plasma interactive demo to use this
	- Update material demo to use this

* Add support for point lights
* Add support for spotlights

* Look into NW for packaging apps https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/
