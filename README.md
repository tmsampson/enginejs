> A lightweight, simplistic library for developing games for the web, utilising HTML, CSS and WebGL.

Welcome to the EngineJS codebase
=======================
EngineJS is a small hobby project of mine, designed to facilitate the development and rapid prototyping of 2D and 3D games for the web, targetting desktop, tablet and mobile.

Project Origins
=======================
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drummertom999/enginejs/master/resources/img/gb-logo.png" width="300"><br>
EngineJS was initially designed for use in my "<i>Nebulous - An Introduction to Game Development</i>" sessions (slides available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RI0fdmmQDTtNAMXE1TyAMnCF57luMgrWFlh2jf8Qq9A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>), delivered at <a href="http://www.gamesbritannia.com/" target="_blank">Games Britannia 2015</a>. The library interface is intentionally high-level and was designed specifically to allow KS4 students to progress from blank screen to fully functional space-shooter in under three hours.

What do I need?
=======================
* NodeJS (+ npm)
* Google Chrome

Getting Started
=======================
* npm install
* node launch.js
