Welcome to the EngineJS codebase
=======================
EngineJS is a small hobby project of mine, designed to facilitate the development and rapid prototyping of 2D and 3D games for the web, targetting desktop, tablet and mobile.

Project Origins
=======================

EngineJS was initially designed for use in my *"Nebulous - An Introduction to Game Development"* sessions (slides available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RI0fdmmQDTtNAMXE1TyAMnCF57luMgrWFlh2jf8Qq9A/edit?usp=sharing)), delivered at [Games Britannia 2015](http://www.gamesbritannia.com/). The library interface is intentionally high-level and was designed specifically to allow KS4 students to progress from blank screen to fully functional space-shooter in under three hours.

What do I need?
=======================
* NodeJS (+ npm)
* Google Chrome

Getting Started
=======================
* npm install
* node launch.js
